## My proposal for an **Innovation Grant**

I[^13] would like to develop **Transdown**[^1], a sofware ecosystem[^5] for presenting transcript-based data. Transdown lets researchers write plain, human-readable transcript like this:

```
Rebecca's Programming Gestures
------------------------------

[00:33:33.25] Rebecca: and then my thinking at least, is
you should be able to, um, say that "star p of i"
/mmhmm/ equals, uh, the title, and then you just do i++,
so then it'll {{move to the next one}} !{makes looping
gesture with left hand}[1] /OK/

[00:34:00.12] Rebecca: and you just keep {{saving each
of the pointers}} !{left hand makes horizontal chops in
the air, like rungs down a ladder}[2]

```

and turns that text into rich web display like ***this***:

\begin{figure}

\caption{A Transdown rendering of the above text that displays in any modern web broswer. The entire idea of Transdown is that users simply write human-readable plaintext, conform to a small set of stylistic conventions, and get beautifully-rendered displays like this. Now imagine how awesome this would look if---instead of static images---these were animated GIFs. Totally possible with Transdown.}
\end{figure}

## Plan: What I'll do

I've already developed a proof-of-concept web view to show this can work.[^2] The main tasks of the project are:

- Standardize a specification for Transdown. We'll have to decide what kinds of features of transcript to support, and more importantly what we won't support.
- Build a back-end parser to convert Transdown text into formatted output options. Initially, we'll focus on one-way HTML: building a parser to turn plain text into a rich web view. Later, if possible, we can build this out to add support for \LaTeX\ and Word.
- Build a dingus[^7] to show users how Transdown syntax gets rendered, following the models of `Fountain`[^8] and `Common Markdown`[^9].
- Develop a front-end to make it easy for users to drop in Transdown and get out a webpage. One possibility is to follow the iPython Notebook Viewer model[^11].


## Motivation: How does this help?

1. Transdown makes it easy for researchers to create beautiful, web-based presentations of transcript data
2. Researchers can embed images and animations into transcript displays with ease
3. It offers a "write once, run multiple places"[^6] approach. Researchers can write one transcript file in Transdown and instantly convert for presenting on the web, embedding in a \LaTeX\ file, or dropping into a Word document.
4. It promotes Reproducible Research[^12]. By making it dead-easy for researchers to share media-rich transcript, we lower the barriers for sharing data.

## Need: Who else has money?

Honestly, I'm not sure. If you know other places I could ask, I'd appreciate it!

## Budget: How much money, and where else is it getting spent?

I think this software ecosystem should exist. I'm willing to build it, and I think I have the right combination of qualitative research experience and software development experience to do it. Moreover, I think it the Transdown ecosystem should be available ***freely*** to anyone who wants to use or modify it under an open-source MIT license.[^10] I'm asking for $2000 to cover my time developing Transdown.

[^5]: Transdown takes both its name and design cues from John Gruber's `Markdown`, an ecosystem for generating rich documents from simple, human-readable plain text. <http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics>. I have to stress: **Transdown is plaintext**. You can open a Transdown file in any text editor, even Notepad.
[^6]: I plan to base Transdown's back-end on `Pandoc`, a powerful open-source document conversion system <http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/>
[^7]: An interactive web sandbox for users to test syntax.
